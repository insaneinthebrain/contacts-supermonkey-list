Hello there.

This program is a simple c++/Qt Gui contacts list manager which I wrote to further my c++ learning.
I am sharing the source incase it may prove usefull to anyone else learning c++

I have included a sample contacts.txt list, though you can also create your own, 
or allow the program to automatically create a blank one for you.
the contacts.txt file will go in the directory the program is compiled into.


This program was created using Qt Creator.
